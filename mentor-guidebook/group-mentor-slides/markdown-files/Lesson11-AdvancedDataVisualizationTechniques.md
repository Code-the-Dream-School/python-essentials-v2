# Lesson 11: Advanced Data Visualization

**Python Essentials — Code the Dream**

---

## Game Plan for Today

| Section | Time | What We'll Do |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Warm-Up | 5 min | Static vs interactive — when to use which? |
| I Do | 10–15 min | Pandas plots, Plotly, Streamlit basics |
| We Do | 15–20 min | Build a Streamlit dashboard together |
| You Do | 5–10 min | Add an interactive widget |
| Wrap-Up | 5 min | Final project checklist & presentations |

<!-- Mentor note: This is the FINAL lesson! The energy should be celebratory — students have come a long way from print("Hello World"). The focus is on Streamlit, which they need for their capstone dashboard. Plotly and Pandas plots are quick reviews. -->

---

## Warm-Up (5 min)

### When Would You Use Each?

| Scenario | Static or Interactive? |
|----------|----------------------|
| A report for your boss (PDF) | ??? |
| An exploration tool for a data team | ??? |
| A chart in a research paper | ??? |
| A live dashboard for monitoring sales | ??? |

**Share your answers in the chat.**

<!-- Mentor note: Answers: (1) Static — PDF can't have interactivity, (2) Interactive — exploration needs filtering/zooming, (3) Static — papers need reproducible figures, (4) Interactive — live data needs real-time updates. The point: the right tool depends on the audience and medium. -->

---

## I Do: Pandas Built-In Plotting

**Pandas can create quick plots directly from DataFrames:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {
    "Month": ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun"],
    "Sales": [100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350],
    "Expenses": [80, 120, 180, 200, 220, 300]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

df.plot(x="Month", y=["Sales", "Expenses"],
        kind="line", title="Sales vs. Expenses")
plt.show()
```

**Supported `kind` values:** `line`, `bar`, `barh`, `hist`, `scatter`, `pie`

> Pandas plotting is great for quick exploration. For polish, use Plotly or Seaborn.

<!-- Mentor note: Pandas plotting is background knowledge this week — it's no longer a required assignment task. The assignment's only focus is the Streamlit capstone dashboard, with an optional Plotly warm-up. Keep this section brief. -->

---

## I Do: Plotly — Interactive Charts

**Plotly creates interactive charts with hover, zoom, and pan:**

```python
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.data as pldata

df = pldata.iris(return_type="pandas")
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_length", y="petal_length",
                 color="species",
                 title="Iris: Sepal vs Petal Length",
                 hover_data=["petal_length"])
fig.write_html("iris.html", auto_open=True)
```

**Key Plotly features:**
- Hover tooltips show data values
- Click and drag to zoom
- Double-click to reset
- Save as PNG from the toolbar

> Don't use `fig.show()` — it can hang. Use `fig.write_html()` instead.

<!-- Mentor note: Assignment Task 3 creates a Plotly scatter plot from the wind dataset. The key learning: Plotly charts are HTML files with embedded JavaScript. They work in any browser. -->

---

## I Do: What Is Streamlit?

**Streamlit turns Python scripts into web apps:**

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("My First App")
st.write("Hello, world!")
```

**Run it:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Opens at:** `http://localhost:8501`

**Why Streamlit?**
- Write Python → get a web app
- No HTML, CSS, or JavaScript needed
- Built-in widgets (sliders, dropdowns, buttons)
- Integrates with Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib

> Streamlit is the tool for your capstone dashboard.

---

## I Do: Streamlit Components

**Text and display:**
```python
st.title("Big Title")
st.header("Section Header")
st.subheader("Subsection")
st.text("Plain text")
st.markdown("**Bold** and *italic*")
st.code("print('hello')", language="python")
```

**Data display:**
```python
st.write(df)              # Auto-renders DataFrames
st.dataframe(df)          # Interactive table
st.metric("Sales", "$500", "+10%")  # KPI card
```

> `st.write()` is the Swiss Army knife — it handles strings, DataFrames, charts, and more.

---

## I Do: Streamlit Input Widgets

**Capture user input for interactive filtering:**

```python
# Text and numbers
name = st.text_input("Your name", "John")
age = st.slider("Age", 0, 100, 25)

# Selection
option = st.selectbox("Choose one", ["A", "B", "C"])
options = st.multiselect("Choose many", ["X", "Y", "Z"])

# Date and toggles
date = st.date_input("Pick a date")
show = st.checkbox("Show details")
if show:
    st.write("Here are the details!")
```

**Important:** Every time a widget value changes, Streamlit **reruns the entire script** from top to bottom with the new values.

<!-- Mentor note: This rerun behavior is the most important concept for students to grasp. It's different from traditional apps where you handle events. In Streamlit, the script IS the app — it runs fresh every time a widget changes. -->

---

## I Do: Streamlit Layout

**Columns — side by side:**
```python
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.header("Left")
    st.write("Content here")
with col2:
    st.header("Right")
    st.write("More content")
```

**Sidebar — persistent navigation:**
```python
st.sidebar.title("Filters")
product = st.sidebar.selectbox("Product", df["Product"])
```

**Expander — collapsible sections:**
```python
with st.expander("Click to see details"):
    st.write("Hidden until expanded")
```

> Use the sidebar for filters. Use columns for metrics. Use expanders for optional detail.

---

## I Do: Streamlit + Plotly

**Plotly charts render beautifully in Streamlit:**

```python
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.bar(df, x="Product", y=["Sales", "Profit"],
             barmode="group",
             title="Sales and Profit by Product")
st.plotly_chart(fig)
```

**Other chart options:**
```python
st.line_chart(df)        # Quick Streamlit line chart
st.bar_chart(df)         # Quick Streamlit bar chart
st.pyplot(fig)           # Embed a Matplotlib figure
st.plotly_chart(fig)     # Embed a Plotly figure
```

> For the capstone dashboard, use `st.plotly_chart()` for interactive charts and `st.pyplot()` for Matplotlib/Seaborn charts.

---

## We Do: Build a Product Dashboard

**Let's build a simple dashboard together — step by step.**

**Step 1:** Create `dashboard_app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

# Sample data
np.random.seed(42)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Product": ["Product A", "Product B", "Product C", "Product D"],
    "Sales": np.random.randint(100, 500, size=4),
    "Profit": np.random.randint(20, 100, size=4)
})

st.title("Product Dashboard")
```

Run it: `streamlit run dashboard_app.py`

<!-- Mentor note: Build this live if possible. Each step adds a new feature. Students should follow along in their own terminals. -->

---

## We Do: Add Sidebar Filters

**Step 2:** Add a product filter in the sidebar:

```python
# Sidebar
st.sidebar.header("Filter Options")
selected = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select Product", df["Product"])

# Filter the data
filtered = df[df["Product"] == selected]
```

**Step 3:** Show metrics for the selected product:

```python
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.metric("Sales", f"${filtered['Sales'].values[0]:,}")
with col2:
    st.metric("Profit", f"${filtered['Profit'].values[0]:,}")
```

> Refresh the browser — select different products and watch the metrics update.

---

## We Do: Add a Chart

**Step 4:** Add a comparison bar chart:

```python
st.subheader("Sales and Profit Comparison")
fig = px.bar(df, x="Product", y=["Sales", "Profit"],
             barmode="group")
st.plotly_chart(fig)
```

**Step 5:** Add a data table:

```python
with st.expander("View Raw Data"):
    st.dataframe(df)
```

**That's a complete dashboard!**
- Sidebar filter for product selection
- Metric cards for key numbers
- Interactive bar chart for comparison
- Expandable raw data table

<!-- Mentor note: This mirrors the capstone dashboard structure. Students will use their scraped weather data instead of random data, and connect to their SQLite database instead of a hardcoded DataFrame. -->

---

## We Do: The Streamlit Pattern

**Every Streamlit app follows this pattern:**

```
1. Import libraries
2. Load data (from CSV, SQL, or API)
3. Create sidebar filters
4. Filter the data based on user selections
5. Display metrics and charts
6. Add layout (columns, expanders, tabs)
```

```python
# The core loop:
data = load_data()                    # Step 2
filter_value = st.sidebar.selectbox() # Step 3
filtered = data[data["col"] == filter_value]  # Step 4
st.metric("Label", filtered["col"].sum())     # Step 5
st.plotly_chart(px.bar(filtered, ...))        # Step 5
```

> Your capstone dashboard follows this exact pattern — just with real data.

---

## You Do: Add an Interactive Widget (5 min)

**Starting from the dashboard we built, add ONE of these:**

1. A **slider** that filters products by minimum Sales value
   *Hint:* `min_sales = st.sidebar.slider("Min Sales", 0, 500, 100)`

2. A **multiselect** that lets users pick multiple products
   *Hint:* `selected = st.sidebar.multiselect("Products", df["Product"])`

3. A **checkbox** that toggles between showing Sales or Profit
   *Hint:* `show_profit = st.checkbox("Show Profit")`

<!-- Mentor note: Set a 5-minute timer. Any of the three is fine. The goal is to practice adding a widget, using its value to filter or modify the display, and seeing the result. -->

---

## Deploying to Streamlit Cloud (Optional)

**Deployment is optional this term — a working local app (`streamlit run`) fully meets the requirements.** If students have time and want their app live, here's how:

1. Push your code to GitHub (include `requirements.txt`)
2. Go to [streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) → log in
3. Click **New App** → select your repo and branch
4. Set the main file path (e.g., `streamlit_app.py`)
5. Click **Deploy**

**`requirements.txt` must include:**
```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
plotly
seaborn
streamlit
```

> Streamlit Cloud auto-redeploys when you push to GitHub.

## Assignment Preview

| Task | What You'll Do |
|------|---------------|
| Optional warm-up | Plotly interactive scatter: wind dataset |
| **Main deliverable** | **Streamlit dashboard for the web scraping capstone!** |

<!-- Mentor note: Week 11 is now a single-deliverable week — the Streamlit capstone dashboard, built on the SQLite database students already created in weeks 9-10. The Kaggle capstone was already finalized back in week 8, so it's NOT due this week. The old standalone Tasks 1-5 (Pandas plots, reflection, commit) have been cut; only an optional, ungraded Plotly warm-up remains, and it needs no separate repo or PR. This is the big — and only — deliverable. -->

---

## Assignment Tips

**Optional Plotly warm-up:** The `strength` column in the wind dataset is a string — clean it with `str.replace()` and convert to float before plotting. This can be done in a Kaggle notebook or a single script; no repo or PR needed.

**Capstone dashboard (the main deliverable):**
- Connect to the SQLite database you built in weeks 9–10
- Add at least 3 visualizations with `st.plotly_chart()`
- Include user interactions (dropdowns, sliders)
- Running locally with `streamlit run` is sufficient; Cloud deploy is optional

---

## Final Project Checklist

**This week's only capstone: the Web Scraping Dashboard.** (The Kaggle Data Pipeline capstone was finalized and submitted back in week 8 — it is not due this week.)

### Web Scraping Dashboard
- [ ] Selenium web scraping → CSV
- [ ] Data cleaning and transformation
- [ ] SQLite database storage (done in weeks 9–10)
- [ ] Streamlit dashboard with 3+ visualizations
- [ ] Runs locally with `streamlit run` (Cloud deployment optional)
- [ ] README with setup steps and screenshot

---

## Project Presentation (Optional)

**Recording a presentation is optional this term and is not graded.** Encourage it as good interview practice, but it should not add pressure during a busy final week. If a student records one, it's a 3–5 minute video of their web scraping dashboard:

1. Demo your Streamlit web scraping dashboard
2. Describe what you built and what you learned

**Recording options:**
- Zoom (record a personal meeting with screen share)
- Built-in screen recording (Mac or Windows)
- Loom (online tool)

**Upload to YouTube (unlisted) and submit the link.**

---

## Wrap-Up

**Today we covered:**
- Pandas built-in plotting for quick visualizations
- Plotly for interactive charts (hover, zoom, export)
- Streamlit: components, widgets, layout, and deployment
- Building a complete dashboard from data to deploy

**You've come incredibly far in this course:**
Python basics → Data structures → Pandas → Visualization → Web scraping → SQL → Dashboards

<!-- Mentor note: Take a moment to celebrate. Students started with variables and print statements. Now they can scrape the web, store data in SQL, and build interactive dashboards. That's an incredible arc. -->
